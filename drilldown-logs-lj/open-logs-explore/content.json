It allows you to visually explore and iterate until you develop a working query or set of queries for building visualizations and conducting data analysis. If your data source supports graph and table data, there's no need to create a dashboard, as Explore can display the results in both formats. This facilitates quick, detailed, real-time data analysis.\n\nWith Explore you can:\n\n- Create visualizations to integrate into your dashboards.\n- Create queries using mixed data sources.\n- Create multiple queries within a single interface.\n- Understand the shape of your data across various data sources.\n- Perform real time data exploration and analysis.\n\nKey features include:\n\n- Query editor, based on specific data source, to create and iterate queries.\n- Query history to track and maintain your queries.\n- Query inspector to help troubleshoot query performance.\n\nTo open a log visualization in Explore, complete the following steps:"
