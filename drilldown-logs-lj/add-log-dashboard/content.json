These panels are created using components that query and transform raw data from a data source into visualizations.\n\nA data source can be an SQL database, Grafana Loki, Grafana Mimir, or an API endpoint. It can even be a basic CSV file. Data source plugins take a query you want answered, retrieve the data from the data source, and reconcile the differences between the data model of the data source and the data model of Grafana dashboards.\n\nTo add a Logs Drilldown visualization to a dashboard, complete the following steps:"
