      "content": "In Alloy, a component is a building block that does one specific job in collecting, processing, or sending telemetry data. It's similar to a LEGO piece where each one has a specific purpose, and you connect them to build a working pipeline.\n\nWhen choosing which components to use, plan out the pipeline you want to create first and visualize the flow of data. Once you have a rough guide, refer to the [Alloy Components](/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/) page for all the available components.\n\nThe following diagram shows the basic minimum components for sending system logs to Loki.\n\n![Diagram showing an example pipeline for sending logs to Loki with Alloy](/media/docs/alloy/diagram-example-logs-loki-alloy.png)\n\n- `local.file_match` - This component searches for log files on your system based on a pattern (like `/var/log/*.log`).\n- `loki.source_file` - This component reads log lines from the files found by `local.file_match`. It parses the logs to prepare them for Loki.\n- `loki.write` - This component sends the processed logs to a Loki backend.\n\nIn the next milestone, you're going to edit the Alloy configuration file to send logs to Loki.\n\n**More to explore (optional)**\n\n- [Components](/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/)\n- [Choose a Grafana Alloy component](/docs/alloy/latest/collect/choose-component/)"
