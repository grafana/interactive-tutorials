  <h1>Welcome to LogQL 101! 📝</h1>
  
  <p>Welcome to your hands-on introduction to LogQL - Grafana Loki's powerful query language for logs! This interactive guide will teach you how to search, filter, and analyze logs like a pro.</p>

  <p>LogQL is inspired by PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) and provides a simple yet powerful way to query and aggregate log data. Let's get started!</p>

  <h2>🎯 What You'll Learn</h2>
  
  <ul>
    <li>🔍 <strong>Basic log queries</strong> - Search and filter logs</li>
    <li>🏷️ <strong>Label selectors</strong> - Filter by metadata</li>
    <li>📊 <strong>Log aggregations</strong> - Count and summarize log data</li>
    <li>⚡ <strong>Advanced patterns</strong> - Parse and extract values from logs</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🚀 Let's Get Started</h2>
  
  <p>In this tutorial, you'll learn how to craft powerful LogQL queries to extract insights from your log data. We'll start with simple queries and progressively build up to more advanced use cases.</p>

  <h2>📚 Select Your Data Source</h2>
  
  <p>Before we can query logs, we need to select a Loki data source. The data source picker allows you to choose which Loki instance to query against.</p>

  <span id="select-datasource" class="interactive" data-targetaction="sequence" data-reftarget="span#select-datasource">
    <ul>
      <li class="interactive"
          data-reftarget='input[data-testid="data-testid Select a data source"]'
          data-targetaction='highlight'
          data-doit='false'>
        <span class="interactive-comment">The <strong>data source picker</strong> is where you select which Loki data source to query. In Grafana, you can have multiple Loki instances configured (e.g., production logs, development logs, different regions). This dropdown allows you to switch between them seamlessly. The selected data source determines which log streams and labels will be available for your LogQL queries.</span>
        Locate the <strong>data source picker</strong> at the top of the Explore page.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </span>
