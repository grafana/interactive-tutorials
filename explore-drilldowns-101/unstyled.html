        <h1>Explore Drilldowns</h1>

        <p>In this part, you'll explore the Drilldowns experience to pivot from metrics to related metrics and logs.</p>

        <h2>Section: Drilldown Metrics</h2>

        <span id="drilldown-metrics"
              class="interactive"
              data-targetaction="sequence"
              data-reftarget="span#drilldown-metrics"
              data-requirements="navmenu-open,has-datasource:prometheus,has-datasource:loki">
          <ul>
            <li class="interactive"
                data-reftarget="a[data-testid='data-testid Nav menu item'][href='/a/grafana-metricsdrilldown-app/drilldown']"
                data-targetaction='highlight'>
              Navigate to the <strong>Metrics</strong> section from the left navigation menu. This is the main entry point for the Metrics Drilldown app, where you can explore all available metrics from your connected Prometheus data sources.
            </li>

            <li class="interactive"
                data-reftarget='div[id="ds"]'
                data-targetaction='highlight'
                data-doit='false'>
              <span class="interactive-comment">This dropdown shows your currently selected <strong>Prometheus data source</strong>. Click it to switch between different data sources if you have multiple configured.</span>
              Notice the <strong>Data source</strong> dropdown at the top. This shows your currently selected Prometheus data source. Click it to switch between different data sources if you have multiple configured.
            </li>

            <li class="interactive"
                data-reftarget='input[placeholder="Filter by label values"]'
                data-targetaction='highlight'
                data-doit='false'>
              <span class="interactive-comment">Use the filter field to narrow down metrics by <strong>label values</strong> (e.g., <code>job = "my-service"</code>).</span>
              <strong>Optional step:</strong> Explore the filter functionality to narrow down metrics by specific label values. This powerful feature allows you to focus on metrics from particular services, instances, or any other labels in your environment. For example, you might filter by <code>job = "my-service"</code> to see only metrics from a specific application, or <code>instance = "localhost"</code> to focus on local metrics.
            </li>

            <li class="interactive"
                data-reftarget='div[data-testid="metrics-list"] div[data-testid="with-usage-data-preview-panel"]:first-child'
                data-targetaction='highlight'
                data-doit='false'>
              <span class="interactive-comment">Look at the first metric card. It shows a <strong>preview chart</strong> and a <em>Select</em> button.</span>
              Examine the structure of the <strong>first metric card</strong> in the grid below. Understanding this layout will help you quickly evaluate and choose metrics across your entire environment. Each metric card is designed to give you immediate insight into the metric's behavior:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Metric name</strong> as a clear, clickable title for identification</li>
                <li><strong>Preview chart</strong> showing recent data trends and patterns over time</li>
                <li><strong>Legend information</strong> displaying aggregation details (avg, sum, etc.)</li>
                <li><strong>Select button</strong> to choose this metric for detailed drilldown exploration</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li class="interactive"
                data-reftarget='div[data-testid="metrics-list"] div[data-testid="with-usage-data-preview-panel"]:first-child button[data-testid*="select-action"]'
                data-targetaction='highlight'>
              Click the <strong>Select</strong> button on any metric that interests you to begin the drilldown exploration. This action will load the selected metric into the drilldown interface, where you can analyze its relationships with other metrics and logs. The system will automatically find related signals based on shared labels and contextual connections.
            </li>

            <li class="interactive"
                data-reftarget='button[data-testid="data-testid Tab Related metrics"]'
                data-targetaction='highlight'>
              Explore the <strong>Related metrics</strong> tab to discover metrics that share common labels or patterns with your selected metric. This powerful feature helps you understand the broader context of your chosen metric by showing correlated measurements from the same services, hosts, or applications. It's an essential tool for troubleshooting and performance analysis.
            </li>

            <li class="interactive"
                data-reftarget='button[data-testid="data-testid Tab Related logs"]'
                data-targetaction='highlight'>
              <span class="interactive-comment"><strong>Note:</strong> To use this feature, you must select a label to filter by that is present in both metrics and logs.</span>
              Navigate to the <strong>Related logs</strong> tab to bridge the gap between metrics and logs. This integration allows you to correlate metric anomalies with log events from the same time period and source. By examining logs that share labels with your selected metric, you can quickly identify root causes, error patterns, and contextual information that metrics alone might not reveal.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </span>

        <h2>ðŸŽ‰ Done!</h2>
        <p>You've learned how to navigate the Metrics Drilldown interface! You can now:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Select your Prometheus data source</li>
          <li>Filter metrics by labels (optional)</li>
          <li>Explore metric preview charts</li>
          <li>Use the drilldown workflow to pivot between metrics and related signals</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This same workflow works with any Prometheus metrics in your environment.</p>
