      "content": "Observability is a cornerstone of site reliability engineering (SRE). It enables engineers to gain deep insights into the health, performance, and behavior of complex systems. By collecting and analyzing telemetry data such as logs, metrics, and traces, observability helps identify and resolve issues before they impact users.\n\nDashboards and visualizations are critical tools in this process. They provide a clear, real-time view of system performance, making it easier to detect anomalies, track trends, and correlate events. For example:\n\n- The trace table shows all traces that match the TraceQL query. While useful in seeing a list of traces, this view is of limited utility in troubleshooting."
