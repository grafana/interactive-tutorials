Instead of having a static dashboard that always shows the same information, variables let you filter, drill down, and explore your traces without having to manually edit queries or create multiple dashboards.\n\nDashboard variables transform your traces dashboards from static reports into powerful, interactive investigative tools, significantly improving your ability to understand, monitor, and troubleshoot distributed systems.\n\nIn this milestone, you'll add a dashboard variable that allows you to filter and explore trace spans based on specific trace IDs.\n\nTo add a dashboard variable, complete the following steps:"
