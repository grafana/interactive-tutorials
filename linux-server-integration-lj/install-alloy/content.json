Alloy offers native pipelines for OTel, Prometheus, Pyroscope, Loki, and many other metrics, logs, traces, and profile tools. In addition, you can use Alloy pipelines to do different tasks, such as configure alert rules in Loki and Mimir. Alloy is fully compatible with the OTel Collector, Prometheus Agent, and Promtail.\n\nTo install Alloy you must either use an existing token or create a token.\n\n**Did you know?** The token safeguards against unauthorized access, ensuring that only you can install Alloy on your Linux machine.\n\nTo install Alloy, complete the following steps:"
