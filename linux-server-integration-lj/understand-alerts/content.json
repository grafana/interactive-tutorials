In this step of the journey, you'll become familiar with these pre-built alerts and learn how to use them to address various problems.\n\n> **Did you know?** If your machine is functioning properly, you won't receive any alerts. No news is good news!"

      "type": "markdown",
      "content": "### NodeClockNotSynchronising\n\n**Description:** Clock not synchronising\n\n**What this means:** The system is currently unable to synchronize its internal clock with an external time source. This could lead to time discrepancies if the system's clock drifts.\n\n**What to do:** Check the Network Time Protocol (NTP) configuration and confirm that the node can reach the specified time server."
    },
    {
      "type": "markdown",
      "content": "### NodeClockSkewDetected\n\n**Description:** Clock skew detected\n\n**What this means:** The system's internal clock is inaccurate and hasn't self-corrected.\n\n**What to do:** Check the Network Time Protocol (NTP) service to ensure it's working correctly and the node can communicate with the designated time server."

    {
      "type": "markdown",
      "content": "### NodeDiskIOSaturation\n\n**Description:** Disk IO queue is high\n\n**What this means:** The system is currently experiencing a significant amount of disk input/output operations. This high level of disk activity can slow down the system's performance.\n\n**What to do:** Check that all processes are running as expected and consider spreading disk-intensive tasks across multiple nodes."
    },
    {
      "type": "markdown",
      "content": "### NodeFileDescriptorLimit\n\n**Description:** Kernel is predicted to exhaust file descriptors limit soon\n\n**What this means:** The kernel, the core component of the operating system, can only manage a limited number of open files simultaneously. The system is nearing this limit, which may cause problems with opening new files.\n\n**What to do:** This is often caused by a process that's opening many files and failing to close them properly."

    {
      "type": "markdown",
      "content": "### NodeHighNumberConntrackEntriesUsed\n\n**Description:** Number of conntrack are getting close to the limit\n\n**What this means:** Conntrack is a component of the Linux firewall that keeps track of active network connections. The system is currently tracking a high number of connections, which could be a sign of a network problem or a potential security threat.\n\n**What to do:** Analyze network traffic to determine the root cause."
    },
    {
      "type": "markdown",
      "content": "### NodeMemoryHighUtilization\n\n**Description:** Host is running out of memory\n\n**What this means:** A memory leak in a program could be causing high memory consumption.\n\n**What to do:** Check that all processes are operating as expected. If applicable, fix the memory leak and restart the affected process, or distribute memory-intensive tasks across multiple nodes."
    },
    {
      "type": "markdown",
      "content": "### NodeMemoryMajorPagesFaults\n\n**Description:** Memory major page faults are occurring at very high rate\n\n**What this means:** The system is heavily relying on disk swapping, which means it's using more memory than is physically available. This significantly degrades performance.\n\n**What to do:** A potential cause is a memory leak, which you should investigate and resolve."
    },
    {
      "type": "markdown",
      "content": "### NodeNetworkReceiveErrs\n\n**Description:** Network interface is reporting many receive errors\n\n**What this means:** Network connectivity issues have been detected.\n\n**What to do:** These could be caused by hardware malfunctions or malicious attacks."
    },
    {
      "type": "markdown",
      "content": "### NodeNetworkTransmitErrs\n\n**Description:** Network interface is reporting many transmit errors\n\n**What this means:** Network connectivity issues have been detected.\n\n**What to do:** These could be caused by hardware malfunctions or incorrect network settings."

    {
      "type": "markdown",
      "content": "### NodeRAIDDegraded\n\n**Description:** RAID Array is degraded\n\n**What this means:** The RAID array is in a critical state and there's a high risk of data loss.\n\n**What to do:** To prevent data loss, repair, or replace the failed disks and rebuild the RAID array as soon as possible."
    },
    {
      "type": "markdown",
      "content": "### NodeRAIDDiskFailure\n\n**Description:** Failed device in RAID array\n\n**What this means:** One of the disks in the RAID array has failed.\n\n**What to do:** While the array is currently operational, replacing the faulty disk is crucial to prevent potential data loss."
    },
    {
      "type": "markdown",
      "content": "### NodeSystemSaturation\n\n**Description:** System saturated, load per core is very high\n\n**What this means:** All CPU cores are operating at maximum capacity, indicating excessive workload.\n\n**What to do:** Consider distributing tasks across multiple servers."
    },
    {
      "type": "markdown",
      "content": "### NodeSystemdServiceCrashlooping\n\n**Description:** Systemd service keeps restarting, possibly crash looping\n\n**What this means:** A particular service is experiencing repeated crashes.\n\n**What to do:** Investigate and resolve the issue to ensure service stability."

      "type": "markdown",
      "content": "### NodeTextFileCollectorScrapeError\n\n**Description:** Node Exporter text file collector failed to scrape\n\n**What this means:** A log file or status indicator that is typically used to gather data for a particular metric is currently unavailable. This is preventing the system from collecting and reporting the necessary data.\n\n**What to do:** Consult the Grafana Alloy and system logs to determine which specific file is inaccessible."
