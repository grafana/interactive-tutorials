It determines whether a metric is unused, partially unused, or an integral part of your observability ecosystem.\n\nIt also analyzes factors such as metric type, number of label values associated, and churn, so that it can provide efficient aggregation recommendations."

            "type": "markdown",
            "content": "## The workflow: Analyze, Recommend, Reduce, Integrate, Adapt\n\n1. **Analyze** — Adaptive Metrics analyzes metric usage across dashboards, alerts, and queries.\n2. **Recommend** — It recommends aggregations to reduce cardinality.\n3. **Reduce** — Based on your approval, the system applies recommendations to lower persisted time series.\n4. **Integrate** — Dashboards, alerts, and queries continue to work seamlessly.\n5. **Adapt** — Analysis is continuous; changes in usage prompt new suggestions."
        },
        {
            "type": "markdown",
            "content": "## Your workflow\n\n1. **Review and apply recommendations** — When the system identifies an opportunity, a recommendation appears. Review it and apply if you agree.\n2. **Customize and control** — Create custom aggregation rules or define Exemptions to protect critical metrics.\n3. **Organize by team with segmentation** — Manage Adaptive Metrics on a per-team or per-service basis.\n4. **Enable auto-apply** — Once comfortable, enable auto-apply for a fully automated workflow."
