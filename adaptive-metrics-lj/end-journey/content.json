Job well done!\n\nWe hope you've enjoyed traveling with us as you:\n\n- Reduced metric cardinality while preserving dashboard and alert fidelity\n- Reviewed and safely applied optimization recommendations\n- Created custom aggregation, drop rules, and exemptions to protect critical series\n- Segmented metrics for team and service ownership\n- Enabled auto-apply for continuous, hands-off optimization\n- Monitored results to validate cost and performance impact"
