Job well done!\n\nWe hope you've enjoyed traveling with us as you:\n\n- Learned the value of SLOs for measuring and improving service reliability.\n- Defined a reliability SLI by identifying success and total event metrics.\n- Created an availability SLO using the Grafana SLO wizard.\n- Configured targets and compliance windows for your reliability objectives.\n- Monitored your SLO and interpreted error budget burndown charts.\n\n## What's next?\n\nNow that you've created your first availability SLO, consider exploring these related topics:\n\n- [SLO documentation](/docs/grafana-cloud/alerting-and-irm/slo/) to learn about alerting on error budget consumption.\n- [Create metric alert rules](/docs/learning-paths/alerting-metrics/) to complement your SLOs with traditional alerting.\n- [Configure Grafana IRM for incident response](/docs/learning-paths/grafana-irm-configuration/) to manage incidents when SLOs are breached."
