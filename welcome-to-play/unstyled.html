  <h2>üìä Explore Visualization Types</h2>
  
  <p>Grafana offers an incredible variety of visualization types to tell your data story. Let's explore the comprehensive examples available.</p>

  <span id="explore-visualizations" class="interactive" data-targetaction="sequence" data-reftarget="span#explore-visualizations">
    <ul>
      <li class="interactive"
          data-reftarget='div[id="4"]'
          data-targetaction='highlight'
          data-doit='false'>
        <span class="interactive-comment">The <strong>Visualization Examples</strong> panel showcases Grafana's extensive visualization library. From <em>time series</em> for trend analysis to <em>bar charts</em> for comparisons, <em>heatmaps</em> for distributions, <em>geomaps</em> for location data, and <em>flame graphs</em> for performance profiling - Grafana provides the right visualization for every data story. Each link leads to a dedicated dashboard demonstrating that visualization type with real data.</span>
        Examine the <strong>Visualization Examples</strong> panel showing the wide variety of chart types available.
      </li>
      
      <li class="interactive"
          data-reftarget='a[href="/d/000000016/time-series-graphs"]'
          data-targetaction='highlight'
          data-doit='false'>
        <span class="interactive-comment"><strong>Time series graphs</strong> are Grafana's most popular visualization type. They're perfect for showing how metrics change over time - think CPU usage, memory consumption, or request rates. The time series visualization supports multiple series, different drawing modes (lines, bars, points), and powerful features like annotations, thresholds, and field overrides.</span>
        Notice the <strong>Time series graphs</strong> option - the foundation of most monitoring dashboards.
      </li>
      
      <li class="interactive"
          data-reftarget='a[href="/d/ktMs4D6Mk/bar-charts-and-pie-charts"]'
          data-targetaction='highlight'
          data-doit='false'>
        <span class="interactive-comment"><strong>Bar charts and pie charts</strong> excel at showing categorical data and proportions. Bar charts are ideal for comparing values across different categories, while pie charts effectively show parts of a whole. These visualizations are commonly used in business dashboards to display things like sales by region, error rates by service, or resource usage by department.</span>
        Look at the <strong>Bar charts and pie charts</strong> examples for categorical data visualization.
