Data sources are the foundation of any Grafana dashboard - they connect your visualizations to the data that powers your insights. Grafana's extensive plugin ecosystem means you can connect to virtually any data source imaginable.\n\nFrom traditional databases and time-series stores to modern APIs, cloud services, and even spreadsheets - if your data exists somewhere, Grafana can visualize it."

It supports multiple data formats including **JSON** for REST APIs, **CSV** for tabular data, **XML** for legacy systems, **GraphQL** for modern APIs, and general API endpoints. Infinity can fetch data from any HTTP endpoint, parse complex nested structures using JSONPath or UQL (Infinity Query Language), apply transformations, and even combine data from multiple sources. It's perfect for integrating third-party APIs, pulling data from custom applications, monitoring external services, or connecting to data sources without native Grafana plugins. The plugin includes advanced features like authentication (Bearer tokens, API keys, OAuth), custom headers, URL parameters, and response parsing options.",

Unlike traditional log systems that index the full text of logs (which can be expensive), Loki only indexes metadata labels, making it cost-effective and highly performant. This example demonstrates parsing **JSON logs from NGINX** in a service mesh environment, showing how LogQL (Loki's query language) can filter, parse, and extract structured data from logs. You can search logs by labels, use regex patterns, calculate metrics from log data, correlate logs with metrics in the same dashboard, and create alerts based on log patterns. Loki excels at cloud-native logging, especially in Kubernetes environments, and integrates perfectly with Prometheus for complete observability.",

You can query specific sheets and ranges, automatically refresh data as the spreadsheet updates, combine spreadsheet data with other data sources in the same dashboard, and use Grafana's transformations to reshape and enrich the data. This is particularly valuable for OKRs and KPIs tracked in sheets, budget and financial data, manual inventory or capacity tracking, survey results and feedback data, or any business process that starts in spreadsheets.
