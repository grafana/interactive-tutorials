# Stable selectors for Grafana Pathfinder tutorials (1 anchor, 1 tutorial)

[Pathfinder](https://grafana.com/docs/learning-journeys/) tutorials anchor steps to DOM selectors, and the ones below target UI this plugin renders (audit: grafana/grafana#129672). Weak anchors (text/placeholder/positional) break silently when copy or layout changes.

## Anchor gone — renamed or removed? (1)

Not found in source, bundle, or a live stack (2026-08-06). Tell us the new selector, or we'll re-record the step.

| anchor | tutorials | searched for |
|---|---|---|
| `button[aria-label='Toggle Parsing options & Result fields']` | infinity-csv-lj/build-dashboard | `Toggle Parsing options & Result fields` |

> [!WARNING]
> 5 tutorials depend on this plugin's existing test ids. Please treat `data-testid`s as part of your public API — do not rename them without pinging the Pathfinder squad first.
