Proper MongoDB authentication and connection configuration ensures secure and reliable metrics collection.\n\nSetting up dedicated monitoring credentials with minimal required permissions follows security best practices and prevents potential access issues.\n\nConsider the following security guidelines:\n\n- Use environment variables or secret management systems for production deployments\n- Limit MongoDB user permissions to only what's required for monitoring\n- Enable SSL/TLS for MongoDB connections in production environments\n- Regularly rotate monitoring user credentials"
