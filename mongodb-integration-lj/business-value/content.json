However, without proper monitoring, performance issues, resource constraints, and operational problems can go undetected until they impact your users.\n\nMonitoring MongoDB with Grafana Cloud provides:\n\n- **Performance visibility**: Track query performance, operation latency, and throughput to identify bottlenecks before they affect users\n- **Resource optimization**: Monitor memory usage, disk I/O, and connection pools to optimize resource allocation and reduce costs\n- **Proactive alerting**: Detect issues like replication lag, high query times, or connection saturation before they cause outages\n- **Operational insights**: Understand database health, replica set status, and cluster performance for informed decision-making\n\nBy the end of this journey, you'll have a complete MongoDB monitoring solution with pre-built dashboards and alerts, giving you immediate visibility into your database performance and health."
