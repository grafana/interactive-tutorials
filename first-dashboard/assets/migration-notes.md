## Validate --package Result

Ran from grafana-pathfinder-app: `node dist/cli/cli/index.js validate --package first-dashboard` (exit 0). Package validated successfully. INFO-level defaults applied: repository, language, schemaVersion, conflicts, replaces.

## Surprises / Notes

- None. Index.json rule matched cleanly; no fallbacks used.
