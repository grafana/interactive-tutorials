This repo contains a file called @index.json which gates recommendations of guides in this
repository.  When new guides come in, we'll need some guidelines on how to recommend them.

Consult these rules to assist users in how to write recommender rules for @index.json. That file
is also a source of good examples on how valid recommender rules are written.

A recommender rule is a single JSON object that is inserted into @index.json.

- ALWAYS use "type": "docs-page"; all guides in this repo should be listed as "type": "docs-page"
- ALWAYS include "title", "description", and "url".  You should always read the guide, and make
default suggestions for title and description based on what is in the guide.
- For URL, ALWAYS use the URL `https://github.com/grafana/interactive-tutorials/tree/main/DIRECTORY_NAME`
where `DIRECTORY_NAME` is the location in this project of where the guide resides.
- ASK THE USER whether the guide pertains to things that are cloud, or both cloud & OSS.
  - If the guide is BOTH, no special rule is needed.
  - If the guide is "Cloud" meaning it should only be targeted to Grafana Cloud, add `{ "targetPlatform": "cloud" }`
  as a match clause.
- ASK the user which app states or URLs the guide should be suggested for. You may consult this list of
app states to make suggestions:  https://github.com/grafana/grafana-pathfinder-app/blob/main/product-knowledge/app-states.mdc.  For example, if the guide deals with SLO or Service Center, that app states list indicates that functionality lives behind URLs like `/a/grafana-slo-app/services`, so you 
would suggest the URL to use to be that one.
  - The user should specify a URL for recommendation; entries cannot be valid without one
  - The user may specify more than one URL
  - All URLs specified become part of the match block, e.g. `{ "urlPrefix": "SPECIFIED URL" }`
- ASK the user if the guide modifies resources or causes users to create new things. These are "mutating guides"
and that means that they cannot be run on environments like Play, where users don't have access to change things.
  - If the user indicates the guide does create new things (or you can infer from reading the guide), this 
  cannot be expressed in JSON match rules at the moment, so simply advise the user of this limitation.
- ALWAYS ensure your JSON is pretty-printed and follows conventions in index.json.
