# Guide PR Review Checklist

When reviewing a PR that adds or modifies content.json files, verify:

## Best Practices Knowledge

- [ ] You have read @best-practices.mdc as background; a good PR review 
that includes changes to a `content.json` file, (and in particular if the
file is being added for the first time) will get feedback relative to these
practices.

## Blocking Issues (must fix)
- [ ] Navigation menu interactions have `navmenu-open` requirement  
- [ ] No fragile selectors (nth-of-type, bare div/span, auto-generated classes)
- [ ] No multistep blocks with only one step
- [ ] No highlight actions targeting form fields with doIt enabled

## Required Structure
- [ ] Uses section blocks instead of markdown headers for groupings
- [ ] Each section has unique `id`
- [ ] No duplicate markdown title at start (title is in metadata)

## Strongly Recommended
- [ ] Sections include "What you will learn" intro
- [ ] Tooltips under 250 characters
- [ ] User-centric language per style guide

## index.json (if modified)
- [ ] Entry has matching `id` to content.json
- [ ] `urlPrefix` matches where guide should appear
