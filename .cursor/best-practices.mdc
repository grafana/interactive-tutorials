# Best Practices

The following best practices are oriented around the idea of defensive 
design. Interactive guides are written to make it easy for beginners
and those without expert knowledge. As such, they cannot be allowed to fail.
Complexity is bad, unmet requirements mean confusion, which is the opposite
of the intent.  All best practices are orienting around creating interactive
guides which are simple, clear, and robust, meaning it is difficult or
impossible to get the guide into a broken state.

### Keep prose very brief

Interactive guides are displayed in a right-hand sidebar. Paragraphs of text are bad, because they
scroll the display vertically. Guides shine when they're very direct and punchy action-oriented
language, not discourse & concepts. Rely on links for concepts.

### Include requirements wherever possible

* Every DOM interaction needs `exists-reftarget`
* Navigation elements need `navmenu-open`
* Page-specific actions need `on-page:/path`
* Be aware of what roles a given feature needs; Admin features need `is-admin` or appropriate role requirements

### Connect Requirements and Objectives

If section 1 has the objective of creating a resource (for example a data source), step 2 should probably 
have the requirement that data source exists.

### Strict Requirements Prevent Breakages

Be aggressive and state as many requirements up front as are reasonably necessary. This guides the user
to fix any missing dependencies, and minimizes the chances they'll go down a broken path they cannot complete.
An example of this is that if step 5 requires admin and can't be skipped, consider promoting the admin requirement
to the top of the section to block starting step 1.

### Use Stable Selectors

* Prefer `data-testid` attributes over CSS classes
* Use `button[data-testid='save']` not `.btn-primary`
* Include fallback selectors for critical elements

### Handle Edge Cases Gracefully

Make admin-only steps `skippable: true` with helpful hints.
Use `objectives` to auto-complete already-done steps.
Provide alternative workflows for different user permissions.

### Don't Put Markdown Titles in Guides

Don't begin your interactive guides with a markdown block which contains
a title, such as:

{
  "type": "markdown",
  "content": "## My Cool Guide"
}

This is because Pathfinder will already render the guide's title in an
enclosing box, and so if you start with things like this, it will end
up duplicating the title twice (once in the surrounding frame, again 
in the content). The `title` of the guide as declared at the top will 
always be displayed.

### Use Interactive Sections, not just Markdown blocks

Rather than doing this:

```json
{ 
  "type": "markdown",
  "content": "## My Section"
},
{
  "type": "markdown",
  "content": "I have things to say"
}
```

You can accomplish the same better by using guide sections like so:

```json
{
  "type": "section",
  "id": "something-unique",
  "title": "My Section",
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "markdown",
      "content": "I have things to say"
    }
  ]
}
```

This is better because it gives the Pathfinder app better control over
visual rendering, and allows the content to be enhanced with closeable
sections, etc.

### Verify State Changes

* Use `verify` for actions that change state
* Include verification after save/create operations
* Check for expected outcomes after navigation

### Write Clear, Actionable Content

* Step descriptions should be action-focused: "Save your dashboard" not "The save button can be clicked"
* Include helpful hints explaining what will happen
* Use interactive comments for complex UI elements

### Structure for Resilience

* Break complex workflows into logical sections
* Use sequence (section blocks) for multi-step processes with dependencies
* Use `multistep` for related actions that should happen together
* Include section completion requirements for dependencies

## Schema Validity

In our CI system, @.github/workflows/validate-json.yml we have strict schema
checking for guides. When you need, you can use this tool locally by scripting
the equivalent, to rigorously check the structure and syntax of a JSON guide.

### Editorial Quality

* Always check for typos
* Always check for consistent use of title case
* Be on the lookout for excess jargon; try to stay focused to known
Grafana technical terms.

### Content Quality

* Keep interactive comments (`tooltip`) under 250 characters
* Use Markdown for formatting UI elements and technical terms
* For content in `tooltip`, keep to one short sentence. Do not use the name of the element being highlighted by the system. For example, instead of "The **Logs** menu opens the Logs page", use "Click to open the Logs page."
* Use user-centric words like those in the following list:
  * Instead of visualization or card, use panel
  * Instead of menu item, use the name of the menu item. For example, instead of "Click the Logs menu item", write "Click Logs."
  * Instead of navigation menu, use main menu.
  * Instead of dropdown, use menu. For example, instead of "the Data source dropdown", write "the Data source menu"
  * Instead of interface, use page, section, or panel.
  * Avoid using button. For example, instead of "Click the Select button", write "Click Select."
  * Only bold titles or names of items on the GUI. For example, do not use "Click the **Logs tab**." Instead, write "Click the **Logs** tab."
  * Do not use integration or plugin. Find another way to describe what you mean.
  * Instead of "**menu button** (three dots)", use "log menu icon (three dots)".
  * Always include "What you will learn" before each section, and "What you have learned" after each section.
  * If an item is to be clicked, only use "Click". Do not use obscure terms like "navigate to", "examine", or "check out".

* Write user-centric descriptions that match mental models
* Include context about why each step matters

```json
{
  "id": "guide-id",
  "title": "TUTORIAL NAME GOES HERE",
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "markdown",
      "content": "# TUTORIAL NAME GOES HERE\n\nWhat you will learn: A brief description of your guide"
    },
    {
      "type": "section",
      "id": "section-id",
      "title": "Section: Heading Name",
      "requirements": ["navmenu-open"],
      "blocks": [
        {
          "type": "interactive",
          "action": "FILL ME OUT",
          "reftarget": "FILL ME OUT",
          "content": "Step 1: User does a thing"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

5. Finally, encourage the user to go edit this file, and remind them of the
other commands that you have available.
