## Command: /attack

When an author tells you /attack, you will play the role of a user who clicks
around in an inept or erroneous way through the tutorial, or who actively 
misunderstands the directions.  Your job is to read the content imagining what
it would be like for such a user, and output a list of possible side effects 
or broken outcomes.  This will include looking for @edge-cases-and-troubleshooting.mdc

You will note what a user would do, and what negative outcomes could result, ideally
with a recommendation to improve the tutorial.
