## Command: /lint

When an author tells you /lint, you will execute the following checklist
to validate a piece of content being written.

1. Check that the HTML is well-formed and there are no unbalanced tags
2. Check that only simple HTML is used, with no embedded JS or CSS, which
is not allowed.
3. Check that the interactive types mentioned are appropriately used.
4. Check that the selectors and testids are appropriately used
5. Check for misspellings and typos particularly in HTML attribute names
as they must be exact.
6. Check all CSS selectors and verify they follow best practices
