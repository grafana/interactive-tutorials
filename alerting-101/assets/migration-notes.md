# Migration Notes: alerting-101

## Files Created

- `manifest.json` — Package manifest for standalone guide; all fields derived from content.json and index.json rule.

## Field Derivation Summary

| Field | Source | Value |
|-------|--------|-------|
| id | content.json | alerting-101 |
| type | — | guide |
| description | index.json rule | Hands-on guide: Learn how to create and test alerts in Grafana. |
| category | — | general (not inside *-lj) |
| author.team | Author Conventions | interactive-learning |
| startingLocation | index.json match | /alerting (first URL from urlPrefixIn) |
| targeting.match | index.json rule | or → urlPrefixIn ["/alerting", "/alerts-and-incidents"] |
| testEnvironment.tier | index.json match | local (no source, no targetPlatform: cloud) |
| depends, recommends, suggests, provides | — | [] |

## Validate --package Result

`node dist/cli/cli/index.js validate --package alerting-101` (run from grafana-pathfinder-app): **PASSED**. Package validated successfully. INFO-level defaults reported for repository, language, schemaVersion, conflicts, replaces.

## Surprises / Notes

- None. Migration was straightforward; index.json rule matched cleanly and all derivations followed manifest-reference.md.
