You can use these plugins to retrieve data from sources like SQL databases, logging systems, time series databases, even API services and many more!\n\nThere's also a plugin system for letting you visualize that data.  Grafana has the most common visualizations built-in, so you can see time series data, tables, bar graphs, and so on immediately.  But other visualization plugins are available for more specific or unusual ways of representing information.\n\nThe fundamental core of Grafana is a *dashboard*. Let's look at one now."

These are the \"building blocks\" of a dashboard. They can be resized and moved around the dashboard so your data is presented in a logical and beautiful way.\n\nEach panel can query data from one (or more) *data sources*.
