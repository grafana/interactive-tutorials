      "content": "Distributed traces provide a way to monitor applications by tracking requests across services. Traces record the details of a request to help understand why an issue is or was happening.\n\nGrafana Traces Drilldown helps you visualize insights from your Tempo traces data. Using the app, you can:\n\n* Use Rate, Errors, and Duration (RED) metrics derived from traces to investigate issues\n* Uncover related issues and monitor changes over time\n* Browse automatic visualizations of your data based on its characteristics\n* Do all of this without writing TraceQL queries"

      "content": "Tracing is best used for analyzing the performance of your system, identifying bottlenecks, monitoring latency, and providing a complete picture of requests processing.\n\n- Decrease mean time to repair and mean time to identify an issue by pinpointing exactly where errors or latency are occurring within a transaction across multiple services.\n- Optimize bottlenecks and long-running code by visualizing the path and duration of requests. Tracing can help identify bottleneck operations and long-running pieces of code that could benefit from optimization.\n- Detect issues with generated metrics. Tracing generates metrics related to request rate, error rate, and duration of requests. You can set alerts against these high-level signals to detect problems.\n- Seamless telemetry correlation. Use tracing in conjunction with logs and metrics for a comprehensive view of events over time, during an active incident, or for root-cause analysis. Tracing shows relationships between services and dependencies.\n- Monitor compliance with policies. Business policy adherence ensures that services are correctly isolated using generated metrics and generated service graphs.\n\n**More to explore (optional)**\n\n- [About Traces Drilldown](/docs/grafana/latest/explore/simplified-exploration/traces/)"
