The data source used is a simple Google Sheet, with all data formatting and aggregation performed using SQL expressions inside Grafana."

      "content": "## The Main Game\n\nThe main part of the game plays out over the first 11 episodes.  Each episode, the players tackle a physical challenge that may also involve solving puzzles.  Success in these challenges earns money towards the overall prize pot.\n\nAt the round table, players discuss theories about who the traitors might be and then vote for the person they think is most likely a traitor.  That person is then banished from the game immediately, revealing their status on the way out.\n\nOvernight, the traitors meet to determine which of the faithful they will murder.  That person leaves the game overnight and the remaining contestants find out who they are when they fail to show up for breakfast in the morning.\n\nContestants may earn a shield during the day's challenge.  This protects them from murder by the traitors.  Sometimes the traitors know who, if anyone, has a shield.  Other times they don't.  Traitors also have the option to recruit a new traitor from the faithful players as an alternative to murdering.\n\n\n\nEach panel in this section uses data contained in a Google Sheet, transformed using only Grafana SQL expressions."

As you'll see in this guide, the data itself is very simple - for each episode we added a row to the spreadsheet for each active player containing just:\n\n- The episode number.\n- The player's name.\n- Which team the player was on in that episode.\n- Who the player voted for in that episode.\n- Whether the player was murdered or banished in that episoide.\n- The date that the episode aired.\n\nAll of the aggregations that you see displayed in the dashboard were created in Grafana using the SQL expressions transformation.  The only data source queries to the Google Sheet simply fetch all the data in the format that it was recorded in.\n\nIn the following sections of this guide, you'll discover how this works..."
