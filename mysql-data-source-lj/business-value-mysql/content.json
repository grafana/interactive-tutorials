MySQL databases are often the backbone of web applications, handling everything from user authentication to business-critical transactions.\n\nWith proper MySQL monitoring through observability, you can:\n\n- **Identify performance bottlenecks** before they impact users\n- **Track query performance** and optimize slow-running queries\n- **Monitor resource utilization** including CPU, memory, and disk I/O\n- **Detect connection issues** and prevent database overload\n- **Ensure data integrity** by monitoring replication lag and errors\n- **Plan capacity** based on growth trends and usage patterns\n- **Reduce mean time to resolution** when database issues occur\n\nIn the next milestone, you'll learn about the specific advantages of using the MySQL data source in Grafana Cloud."
