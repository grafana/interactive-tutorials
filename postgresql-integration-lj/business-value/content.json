Without proper monitoring, database issues can go undetected until they impact application performance or cause service interruptions.\n\nMonitoring PostgreSQL databases provides critical insights into query performance, connection handling, storage utilization, and replication health. This observability enables proactive identification of bottlenecks, capacity planning, and optimization opportunities before they affect your applications.\n\nGrafana Cloud provides the following advantages for PostgreSQL monitoring:\n\n- Pre-built dashboards with essential PostgreSQL metrics for immediate insights\n- Comprehensive alerting rules that notify you of performance issues and anomalies\n- Centralized log collection and analysis for troubleshooting and audit trails\n- Integration with observability infrastructure through Grafana Alloy\n- Cost-effective monitoring solution that scales with your database infrastructure\n- Historical data retention for trend analysis and capacity planning\n\nIn the next milestone, you navigate to the PostgreSQL integration page in Grafana Cloud and select your platform."
