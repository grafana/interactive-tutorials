    <h1>Network diagnostics in Kubernetes Monitoring</h1>

    <p>
      Network performance directly impacts application responsiveness, reliability, and user experience. 
      When applications are slow or experience connectivity issues, network metrics help you quickly determine 
      whether the network is the bottleneck or if issues lie elsewhere.
    </p>

    <h3>What you will learn</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Navigate to the Network tab and understand network bandwidth and saturation metrics.</li>
      <li>Identify network performance issues like high traffic, packet loss, and saturation.</li>
      <li>Use the pod and interface breakdown views to pinpoint which workloads are consuming bandwidth or experiencing problems.</li>
      <li>Apply diagnostic workflows to troubleshoot common network scenarios.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key concepts</h2>
    
    <h3>Network Bandwidth</h3>
    <p>
      Network bandwidth shows how much data is flowing in and out of your workloads:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rx (Receive)</strong>: Incoming traffic - data coming into the namespace/pod</li>
      <li><strong>Tx (Transmit)</strong>: Outgoing traffic - data going out of the namespace/pod</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Network Saturation</h3>
    <p>
      Network saturation indicates whether your network is overwhelmed by showing dropped packets. 
      Zero dropped packets is ideal - any non-zero value indicates network stress that can cause 
      application timeouts, retries, and performance degradation.
    </p>

    <h2>Diagnostic scenarios</h2>

    <h3>Scenario 1: Application is slow</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Check namespace Network Bandwidth - is traffic unusually high?</li>
      <li>Check Network Saturation - are packets being dropped?</li>
      <li>Review Network Bandwidth by pod - is one pod consuming excessive bandwidth?</li>
      <li>If saturation is high, increase network limits or optimize data transfer</li>
      <li>If saturation is zero, the issue is likely application-level, not network</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Scenario 2: Intermittent connectivity issues</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Look for periodic drops in bandwidth (indicates flapping)</li>
      <li>Check for saturation spikes (temporary overload)</li>
      <li>Review by interface view - is a specific interface failing?</li>
      <li>Investigate pod restarts, network policy changes, or infrastructure issues</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Scenario 3: High network costs</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Check total bandwidth over time to identify trends</li>
      <li>Use by pod breakdown to find data-intensive services</li>
      <li>Compare Rx vs Tx - are you sending/receiving more than expected?</li>
      <li>Optimize data transfers, implement caching, or review service mesh overhead</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Scenario 4: New deployment causing issues</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Check for bandwidth spike during deployment (image pulls, init containers)</li>
      <li>Compare traffic before/after deployment</li>
      <li>Check if saturation occurred (did deployment cause network stress?)</li>
      <li>Consider staggering deployments, pre-pulling images, or increasing capacity</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What you will learn</h2>
    <p>By the end of this guide, you will be able to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Navigate to network metrics at the namespace and pod level</li>
      <li>Interpret Network Bandwidth panels to understand traffic patterns and identify anomalies</li>
      <li>Use Network Saturation panels to detect packet loss and network capacity issues</li>
      <li>Drill down from namespace to pod to interface to isolate network problems</li>
      <li>Apply diagnostic workflows to troubleshoot common network performance scenarios</li>
      <li>Distinguish between network-level issues and application-level problems</li>
    </ul>
