# Migration Notes: prometheus-lj

## Files Created

- `manifest.json` — path-level manifest (type: path, 9 steps, no index.json rule)
- `content.json` — path-level cover page derived from website `_index.md`
- `add-data-source/manifest.json`
- `add-data-source-url/manifest.json`
- `business-value-olly/manifest.json`
- `business-value-prom/manifest.json`
- `config-authentication/manifest.json`
- `end-journey/manifest.json`
- `select-private-connection/manifest.json`
- `verify-ds-connection/manifest.json`
- `verify-prom-data/manifest.json`

## Field Derivation Summary

| Field | Source | Value |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Path id | Directory name | prometheus-lj |
| Path type | — | path |
| Path description | _index.md (no index.json rule) | Condensed from _index.md frontmatter description |
| Path category | _index.md journey.group | data-availability |
| Path author.team | Author conventions | Grafana Documentation |
| Path testEnvironment | No match → default | { "tier": "cloud" } |
| Path targeting | — | Omitted (no index.json rule for prometheus-lj) |
| Path startingLocation | — | Omitted (no URL derivable) |
| Path steps | Website step weight order + pathfinder_data | 9 step IDs in weight order |
| Path recommends | _index.md journey.links.to | drilldown-metrics-lj |
| Path suggests | _index.md related_journeys | private-data-source-connect-lj |
| Step id | Each step content.json | prometheus-* (per step) |
| Step description | Website step index.md description | One-line condensed |
| Step category | Path _index.md journey.group | data-availability |
| Step depends/recommends | Step weight order | Chain: first no depends, last no recommends |
| Step suggests | side_journeys links to /docs/learning-paths/* | add-data-source-url, select-private-connection → private-data-source-connect-lj |

## Flags for Manual Review

- Path has no `index.json` rule: `targeting` and `startingLocation` omitted; consider adding a rule if this path should be contextually recommended.

## Dangling References

- `suggests`: private-data-source-connect-lj (directory does not exist in repo; may be not-yet-migrated).
- Path `recommends`: drilldown-metrics-lj (exists). Path `suggests`: private-data-source-connect-lj (dangling).

## Data Quality Issues

- **journeys.yaml vs _index.md**: journeys.yaml has `prom-data-source.links.to: metrics-drilldown`; _index.md has `journey.links.to: drilldown-metrics`. Used _index.md value (drilldown-metrics → drilldown-metrics-lj). Mismatch flagged for website team reconciliation.
- **Duplicate step descriptions**: Website steps business-value-olly and business-value-prom both had description "Learn about observability and how it can help you solve real-world problems." business-value-prom manifest was given a distinct one-line summary to avoid catalog duplicate; consider aligning upstream.

## Validate --package Results

- **Path**: `node dist/cli/cli/index.js validate --package prometheus-lj` — ✅ passed (run from grafana-pathfinder-app). Warnings: targeting not specified, startingLocation not specified.
- **Steps**: All 9 step packages validated ✅ (add-data-source, add-data-source-url, business-value-olly, business-value-prom, config-authentication, end-journey, select-private-connection, verify-ds-connection, verify-prom-data).

## Surprises / Notes

- All website steps had `pathfinder_data` frontmatter; no directory-name fallback was needed.
- Path-level content.json did not exist before migration; created from _index.md with Hugo shortcodes stripped.

## TODO

- [ ] Add index.json rule for prometheus-lj if path should be contextually recommended (to populate targeting and startingLocation).
- [ ] Reconcile journeys.yaml `metrics-drilldown` vs _index.md `drilldown-metrics` with website team.
